                    <h2>Jacob Kramer</h2>
                    <p>I am a Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Git, and Figma, complemented by hands-on project experience and a keen eye for creating user-friendly, responsive web applications. I have successfully earned certifications in Meta Front-End Development and Web Development using JavaScript on CodeChef, which have enhanced my ability to build and maintain intuitive, aesthetically pleasing websites.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I work as a Participant Relationship Manager at Morgan Stanley (since October 2024), where I leverage my technical and communication skills to strengthen client relationships and provide tailored solutions. In my previous role as a Time and Expense Operations Supervisor at TEKsystems, I led cross-functional projects, collaborated with multiple teams, and enhanced processesâ€”skills that translate well into managing complex development tasks and working in agile environments.</p>

                    <p>My technical knowledge is complemented by my ability to work effectively in team settings, adapt to change, and maintain a positive, solution-oriented mindset. I am passionate about building engaging digital experiences and am eager to apply my front-end expertise to innovative projects that prioritize both functionality and design.</p>
